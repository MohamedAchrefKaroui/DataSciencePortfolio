## Project 1: Celebrity Classification using VGG16 (transfer learning)

- **Description**: In this project, I trained a VGG16 model on a dataset of images containing pictures of celebrities. The goal was to classify the celebrities accurately using deep learning techniques.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, VGG16, image preprocessing, deep learning.
- **Key Achievements**: 
  - Achieved an accuracy of 90% on the celebrity classification task.
  - Implemented transfer learning with the VGG16 model to leverage pre-trained weights.

## Project 2: Meteorite Landings Visualization and Prediction

- **Description**: In this project, I explored a dataset containing information about meteorite landings worldwide. I performed data visualization to gain insights into the distribution of meteorite landings across the globe. Additionally, I developed a predictive model to estimate the potential landing locations of meteorites based on various features.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, machine learning, geospatial data analysis.
- **Key Achievements**: 
  - Created interactive visualizations of meteorite landing locations using maps and graphs.
  - Developed a machine learning model to predict potential landing locations.
- **Code**: [Link to the Project 2 repository](https://github.com/MohamedAchrefKaroui/DataSciencePortfolio/blob/main/meteorite-visualization-and-prediction.ipynb)

## Project 3: Number of Deaths by Age Group
Description: In this project, I analyzed a dataset containing information about the number of deaths in different age groups. I created a bar chart to visualize the number of deaths in three categories: Firearm Deaths, Alcohol-Related Deaths, and Suicide Deaths.
Technologies Used: Python, Pandas, Plotly, Numpy, Seaborn.
Key Achievements:
- Visualized the number of deaths in different age groups using a bar chart.
- Compared the number of deaths across three categories.
